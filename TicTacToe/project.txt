Steps to making a C# Tic Tac Toe game

1. create a class for Players - Players.cs
2. create a class for the game Board - Board.cs
3. create a class for game management - GameManagement.cs

The players class will be a simple class that will hold the players name and symbol (X or O).
The game board class will have the methods for displaying the board and methods for moves and
moves validation. I will be using a 2d array for the game board and location.
